You're right, looping through the TSV file multiple times can be inefficient. Here's an updated version that reads the TSV file only once and writes to CSV files on-the-fly:

```python
import csv
import os

tsv_file_path = 'your_input_file.tsv'
output_folder = 'output_folder/'
group_column = 'specific_column_name'

# Create a dictionary to store CSV writers for each unique value
csv_writers = {}

# Read TSV file and process rows
with open(tsv_file_path, 'r', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as tsvfile:
    reader = csv.DictReader(tsvfile, delimiter='\t')
    
    for row in reader:
        value = row[group_column]
        output_file_path = os.path.join(output_folder, f'{value}_output.csv')

        if value not in csv_writers:
            # Create CSV writer for the group if it doesn't exist
            with open(output_file_path, 'w', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as csvfile:
                fieldnames = reader.fieldnames
                csv_writers[value] = csv.DictWriter(csvfile, fieldnames=fieldnames)
                csv_writers[value].writeheader()

        # Write the row to the corresponding CSV file
        csv_writers[value].writerow(row)

print("CSV files created successfully.")
```

This code reads the TSV file once and processes each row, writing it to the appropriate CSV file based on the unique value in the specified column. The `csv_writers` dictionary is used to keep track of CSV writers for each unique value, avoiding the need to loop through the TSV file multiple times.
