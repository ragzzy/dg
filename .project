Certainly! You can modify the code to check whether the output CSV file already exists and then either create a new file or append to the existing one. Here's an updated version:

```python
import csv
import os
from collections import defaultdict

tsv_file_path = 'your_input_file.tsv'
output_folder = 'output_folder/'
group_column = 'specific_column_name'

grouped_data = defaultdict(list)

# Read TSV file and group data
with open(tsv_file_path, 'r', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as tsvfile:
    reader = csv.DictReader(tsvfile, delimiter='\t')
    for row in reader:
        value = row[group_column]
        grouped_data[value].append(row)

# Process each group
for value, data in grouped_data.items():
    output_file_path = os.path.join(output_folder, f'{value}_output.csv')

    # Check if the file already exists
    if os.path.exists(output_file_path):
        # Append to existing CSV file
        with open(output_file_path, 'a', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as csvfile:
            writer = csv.DictWriter(csvfile, fieldnames=reader.fieldnames)
            writer.writerows(data)
    else:
        # Create a new CSV file
        with open(output_file_path, 'w', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as csvfile:
            writer = csv.DictWriter(csvfile, fieldnames=reader.fieldnames)
            writer.writeheader()
            writer.writerows(data)

print("CSV files updated or created successfully.")
```

This code uses `os.path.exists` to check if the output CSV file already exists. If it does, it opens the file in append mode (`'a'`) and appends the data. If the file doesn't exist, it creates a new file and writes the header and data as before.
