Here are some interview questions that you can use to assess a mid-level candidate's experience and skills in Azure Cloud Data Engineering, Python, PySpark, Snowflake administration, and Databricks:

### Azure Cloud Data Engineering
1. **Describe a project where you utilized Azure Data Factory (ADF). What challenges did you encounter, and how did you overcome them?**
2. **How do you manage data security and compliance on Azure? Can you provide examples of services or features you have used?**
3. **Explain how you would design a data pipeline on Azure for processing large volumes of data. What services would you use, and why?**

### Python and PySpark
4. **Can you explain how you've used PySpark to optimize data processing tasks? What are some performance tuning techniques you’ve applied?**
5. **How do you handle error handling and logging in your Python scripts used for data engineering?**
6. **What are some of the common performance bottlenecks you’ve encountered while working with PySpark, and how did you address them?**

### Snowflake Administration
7. **Walk me through the steps you would take to optimize a slow-running query in Snowflake.**
8. **How have you managed Snowflake accounts, users, and roles? Can you discuss the security best practices you follow?**
9. **Explain how you would set up data sharing between multiple Snowflake accounts. What considerations need to be taken into account?**

### Databricks
10. **How have you used Databricks for ETL processes? Can you provide an example of a complex pipeline you built?**
11. **Describe a situation where you needed to scale a Databricks cluster. What factors did you consider when doing this?**
12. **What are some best practices for managing and organizing notebooks in Databricks? How do you ensure code quality and maintainability?**

### General Data Engineering Concepts
13. **How do you approach data versioning and lineage in your data pipelines?**
14. **What is your strategy for handling schema changes in data sources?**
15. **Describe a time when you had to troubleshoot a failing data pipeline. What steps did you take to identify and resolve the issue?**

These questions should help you evaluate the candidate’s technical skills, problem-solving abilities, and experience with the specific tools and platforms they’ll be working with.
