You're correct, and for large datasets, it can be more memory-efficient to process the data without storing all groups in memory. Here's an alternative approach using a generator and writing to CSV files on the fly:

```python
import csv
import os

tsv_file_path = 'your_input_file.tsv'
output_folder = 'output_folder/'
group_column = 'specific_column_name'

# Function to generate rows for a specific group
def generate_rows_for_group(tsv_file, group_value):
    with open(tsv_file, 'r', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as tsvfile:
        reader = csv.DictReader(tsvfile, delimiter='\t')
        for row in reader:
            if row[group_column] == group_value:
                yield row

# Read TSV file to get unique values in the specified column
with open(tsv_file_path, 'r', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as tsvfile:
    reader = csv.DictReader(tsvfile, delimiter='\t')
    unique_values = set(row[group_column] for row in reader)

# Process each unique value and write to CSV file
for value in unique_values:
    output_file_path = os.path.join(output_folder, f'{value}_output.csv')

    with open(output_file_path, 'w', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as csvfile:
        fieldnames = reader.fieldnames
        writer = csv.DictWriter(csvfile, fieldnames=fieldnames)
        writer.writeheader()

        # Use the generator to get rows for the specific group and write to the CSV file
        rows_for_group = generate_rows_for_group(tsv_file_path, value)
        writer.writerows(rows_for_group)

print("CSV files created successfully.")
```

This approach avoids storing all grouped data in memory and processes each group on-the-fly, which can be more efficient for large datasets.
